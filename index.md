## 🧬 Featured Research: Quantum AI for Cancer Detection
### *Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network (HQ-CNN)*

[cite_start]I engineered a novel AI architecture that bridges **Quantum Computing (PennyLane)** and **Deep Learning (TensorFlow)** to detect early-stage Esophageal Cancer[cite: 118].

* **The Problem:** Traditional Deep Learning struggles with "speckle noise" in low-data medical imaging.
* **My Solution:** Replaced the bottleneck layer of EfficientNet-B0 with a **6-qubit Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC)**.
* **Key Results:**
    * [cite_start]**Accuracy:** 95.98% (vs. ResNet50 baseline)[cite: 119].
    * [cite_start]**Sensitivity:** 94.3% for early-stage Dysplasia[cite: 120].
    * **Innovation:** Developed a "Quantum Bottleneck" to reduce overfitting.
